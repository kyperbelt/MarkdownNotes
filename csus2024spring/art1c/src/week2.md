    - People and ideas are exaggerated. vibrant colors and displaying action.

* **work/site**


### Realism (date)
* **Context**
    - Events and people 

### Orientalism 
#### What is the orient? 
> TODO: Insert Delacroix Death of SArdanaplulus 

In france at this time (1800s). **The orient** did not only refer to asian, it also meant the middle eastern cultures. 

> Good to think about how these areas were stereotyped. We create fanatsies about these other areas when we have not visited them. 

* **Key point** the idea of the orient was during a time when the west was trying to colonize these areas, so depicting them as primitive was to the benefit of the colonizers. 

> :information_source: Its not always meant to be derogatory. 

* Primitivism vs Orientalism 

* **Decolinazation** 

### Delacroix 

> Todo: Image of Turkish Bath vs 

intesting to see the difference in Delacroix work from before he went to the places he drew and then after. Before he would draw lots of nude women in these turkish baths or brothels, but after he visits he draws them more clothed and th men are even drawn with more respect than before. 

### Goya 

> TODO: Image Family of Charls IV 1800

He was frowned upon for drawing the royal family too realistically, where they looked too average. 

Goya was a skilled printer (lots of work done on edgings on copper plates).

* **Key point** he was critial of the status quo around 1799 

Napoleon installs his brother as ruler of spain. Goya creates the disasters pictures to comment on the brutality from both sides.

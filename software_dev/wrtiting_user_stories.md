- Facilitate story point estimates.


### What Should it Include?

- **Functional Criteria** :Identify User specific tasks, functions, or business processes that must be in place.
- **Non-Functional Criteria**: Identify specific non-functional conditions the implementation must meet, such as **security elements**.
- **Performance Criteria**: If specific performance is critical to the acceptance of a story, it should be included. For example: Request response times should be spelled out as a threshold.

# 137 Computer Organization notes

## Digital Systems as Von Neumann Machines
* **Computer system that contains** 
    - One or more processors
    - Memory 
    - Control Unit: maintains control of system
        - Control activities
        - supervises flow of data
        - directs flow of data
        - transfer result to and from memory
        - fetches from memory to output device
    - I/O devices
    - OS and application programs
> :warning: Von neumann Bottleneck: Competing system measure limitation. Inadequate rate of data transfer between cpu and memory.
* **Embedded System that is**
    - A  complete system as circuit board or ASIC or FPGA, known as a SoC
        - cpu and memory
        - dedicated software known as firmware
    - May include tx/rx modules
    - May include signal convesion modules
    - Applications: 
        - Cellphones, camcorders
        - Host device controller interface (USB)

### Von Neumann Computer
* **Processing core (CPU) consists of**
    - Data path that includes
        - Digital cirtuict modules perform computations
        - Storage modules store computed data.
    - Controller that orders data path operations

* **A microcomputer that includes**
    - Multicore Processor(s)
    - Memory
    - Interconnection medium
    - I/O Devices
    - I/O Device controller and interface
    - Potential for bottleneck between faster processor and slower memomry.

## SOP Expressions
* **Demorgans Theorems** 
$$\neg_{x} \land \neg_{y} = \neg_{(x\lor y)}$$

## Combinational Circuits


### Small Circuits

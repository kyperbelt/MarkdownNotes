## Culture and Multiculturalism

* **What is Multiculturalism in Education**: Values different studetn cultures and prepares students to thrive in a diverse world. At its core, multicultural education fosters equality, justice, and equity, and it establishes the reality of philosophical ideals in classroom environments. Mutlicultural education is what schools implement to establish equitable educational opportunities for all their students. It is also an ongoing process of helping studetns succeed in their academic and personal lives.

* **What it is not** : It is not books which have a sense of *othering*, or a feeling of being *left out* or being made to feel *exotic*. Multicultural books are not books which do not act as mirrors and windows.

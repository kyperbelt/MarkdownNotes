# Week 4 Notes

## Notes

- Scientific antirealism: empirical adequacy.
- Scientific realism: point of science is truth. 


- **Aristotle** (way back) 
- **Francis Bacon** (1561-1626)

- **Rene Descartes** (1596-1650) :heart:
    - Was trying to explain **magnetism**  
        - **Armed with the theory*  Physical contact explains movement
        - magnets do not follow that theory.
        - **His explaination**: invisible strings/hooks coming from magnet. (:laughing:) 
    - **Retroduction** 
        - **Includes a mix of** Induction, Abduction and Deduction
            - **Induction** : All magnets attract metal
            - **Abduction** : Hypothezies explaination for above.
            - **Deduction** : Use explaination to make further predictions.
        - **Rome Example:** never been to rome so no exist. 
        - **Avoids irrational conclusions based on strict empiricism** 
        - **Example**:
            1. Induction:
                - Magnet 1 attracts metal
                - Magnet ... attracts metal
                - Magnet n attracts metal
                - $\therefore$ all magnets attract metal
                > By induction you tentatively postulate a generalization. This is what you are looking to explain
            2. Abduction:
                - Maybe there are hook shaped micro particles arranged as strings, which pull metal towards the magnet.
                > By abduction you hypothesize(postulate) that there is an observable cause to the generalization the **induction** step.
            3. Deduction: 
                - I predict that more magnets will behave in the same manner.
                > By deduction you make a prediction and you are willing to throw away your hypothesis if the prediction fails.
    - **$\boxed{\text{Electron Hypothesis}}$** 
        1. Ex1
            - Metal 1 in humid environment corrodes
            - Metal 2 in humid environment corrodes
            - Metal 3 in humid environment corrodes
            - $\therefore \boxed{\text{All metals in humid environment correde!}}$
        2. Ex2
            - Plant 1 grows when watered
            - Plant 2 grows when watered
            - Plant 3 grows when watered
            - $\therefore \boxed{\text{All plants grow when watered.}}$
        3. Ex3
            - Person 1 acts weird when drunk
            - Person 2 acts weird when drunk
            - Person 3 acts weird when drunk
            - $\therefore \boxed{\text{All people act weird when drunk}}$   
        > :warning: :construction: :warning: Explainations for each of the examples assume that **Electrons** exist! That is an unobservable hypothesis. You can use it to hypothesize many other phenomena like **Electrocution**, **Atomic Explosions** etc. 
        > :warning: :construction: :warning: NO certainty in Science!

- **Isaac Newton** (1643-1727) :goat:
- **David Hume** (1711-1776)
- **Charles Perce** (1839-1914)
- **Karl Popper** (1902-1994)

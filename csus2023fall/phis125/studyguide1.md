### Bacon's explaination of heat

**Observable phenomenon** 

| HOT    | COLD    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| teacup(1)| teacup(2) |

1. Why do I experienc epain when I touch 1 instead of 2?
> :warning: Talking about sensation here. What is the difference in sensation. **Sensation is empirical information collected with the senses.** 

* **Q:** What is the explaination of this observ. phenom. 
> :teacher: You can say that one of them was in a stove, where as the liquid in the other wasnt :warning: BUT that explains the history of the liquid in the cups, not what the difference at the time is.

> :information_source: We are looking to figure out what is causing the heat at the moment.

##### Francis Bacon: 
"There are **invisible micro particles** of water (1) vibrating very fast."
according to him: "These are real particles which are not merely hypothesized but have been discoverd.

##### History of micro particles

###### 450BC-350BC

**Greek Atomist** :\
$\boxed{\text{Democritus}}$
- There are indivisible particles of matter invisible to the naked eye of humans.
    - Atoms: a - temnein -> no - tocut -> impossible to cut. 

###### 1596-1650
**Rene Descartes**: Said that matter is infinitely divisible. $\therefore$ there are micro particles invisible to humans.

> :warning: Bacon was wrong, his prediction was only a hypothesis. Micro particles had not been discovered.


##### Difference between 1 and 2
Phenomenon to be explained(explanandum) based observable.
**Possible explainations**
1. Water is angry in (1) but calm in (2)
2. There is caloric fluid in (1) but not in (2)
3. There are micro particles in (1) that are vibrating, but not in (2)
> The point of these above is that they are explainations about things we cannot see **The unobservable** . **Causality** 

criteria to make 1 the winner: 
- **Simplicity**: keep new posits(entities that your process) to a minimum.
    > connection < entitiy in terms on new

> :warning: Heat Transfer Example: vibrations suck to explain this.

###### Chose one explaination and make explicit the criteria you use to determine which explaination is the BEST

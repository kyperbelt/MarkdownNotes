* **Why does the number of people on a team matter? What is considered a large team and why are large teams not recommended?**

The number of people matters because having too many people can lead to communication problems, and having too litle people can lead to a lack of ideas. Anything over nine people is considered a large team and anything under 3 is considered too small. 

* **Explain self organizing teams.**

Self organizing teams are teams where the manager does not place people into what they think is a good spot but instead lets that person choose thier position on the team. This is because, often times the manager does not have enough information about the persons interests or capabilities.

* **How do you know if a team is working at an unsustainable pace.**  

One way to know if a team is working at an unsustainable pace if they are pushing to complete work just before a demo or deadline. Another way to know if the team wants a break after every chink of work because they are working overtime all of the time.

## Scientific Realism vs Antirealism

### Aguste Comte 1800
1. **Theological Stage**
    Explain natural phenomena appealing to super natural forces.
    (*example*: rain caused by crying gods)
2. **Metaphysical Stage** 
    You explain natural phenoma by unobservable principles or causes.
    (*example*: Substances, occult, powers, etc.)

> Rene Descartes
3. **Logical or positivist Stage**
    Science doesnt explain things only describes the observable behavior of physical objects.
    ( *Example:* What is force? the acceleration of the speed of a mass) 
    > :construction: example by prof throwing markers around like a cat :cat: off the table.

## Logical Positivists are intellectual heirs of conte and Hume

* **Statements** 
    A linguistic object cable of being true or false.
    - 1 Analytic
        - math
        - logic
        - definitional (*triangles, bachelor*)
    - 2 Empirical
        - nature
        - can be expressed in observable terms. (*See force example up top*)
    - 3 Non-Statements
        - ethical remark    
        - asthetical remark
        - noises
Example list: 
    - **3**  Grapes are Delicious
    - **1**  2+2=4 
    - **2** The sky is blue 
    - **2** Water tempertature is 100C
    - **2** Kinetic Energy of this bell is 20J 
    - **2** The current king of Peru is Bald.
    - **2** The mass of an electron is X
    - **3** Wax is an extended substance 
    - **3** I love you 
    - **2** The acceleration due to gravity is approx 10/ms

> :warning: Since there is no dephts; there is surface everywhere. Sience is about describing and predicting observable phenomena.

* **Then why is science full of unobservable things?** (*Think electrons* ) 
    - The **logical positivist response to this is:**
        - yes but those unobservable things are always cashed out in observational terms.
        - moreover, unobservable properties or entities/processes are nothing more than the outcome of **operational protocols**.
* **What is...** 
    > must define unobservable in operational terms that can be measured.
    - **Love?** 
        - **operational protocols** 
    - **Temperature?** 
    - **Intelligence?** 
    - **Energy?** 
    - **Atom** 


## Problems with logical positivism
> person intellect example "you are a wizard harry"
Different operational protocols giving the same result forces LP to say the they are coincidental 

### What do Logical positivist think about light?
- How do they think that it works?
- what do they think about photons (1905) ? do they believe in it?
- How do cameras work first invented (1816)?

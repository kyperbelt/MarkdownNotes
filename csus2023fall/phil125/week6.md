## Scientific Realism vs Antirealism

### Aguste Comte 1800
1. **Theological Stage**
    Explain natural phenomena appealing to super natural forces.
    (*example*: rain caused by crying gods)
2. **Metaphysical Stage** 
    You explain natural phenoma by unobservable principles or causes.
    (*example*: Substances, occult, powers, etc.)

> Rene Descartes
3. **Logical or positivist Stage**
    Science doesnt explain things only describes the observable behavior of physical objects.
    ( *Example:* What is force? the acceleration of the speed of a mass) 
    > :construction: example by prof throwing markers around like a cat :cat: off the table.

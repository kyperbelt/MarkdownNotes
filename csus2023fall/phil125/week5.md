### humes solution
### why his solution sucks
### provide example from class
### provide example of your own.

## Question 2
### Explain process of retroduction
>  Focused only on inference
### Example from class
### Example of your own


### 1920->Marry Heger (astronomer)
- Diffuse interstellar bonds.
    - What is inside the gaps.
### 1985 -> Harry Kroto (AstroChemist)
- Intrigued by bands. 
- He hypothesized - there is def. graphite, but its unstable.
    - Pure carbon was only known as graphite or diamond
    - Graphite has become stable to occupy the bonds.
    - He thinks he can create the same conditions of space graphite on earth.
    - Laser from Texas.

### Ernan Mcmullin
- "The inference that makes science" (1992)
    - **Defends retroduction** as the inference that makes it science. 
- scientific Realist
    - Regarding unobservables.
### Bas C. VanFrassen (2013 reprint)
- He is a **critic of retroduction**
    - he says retroduction is a bad form of inference
    - He thinks it is circular and should not be used.
- since the 80s has been underminging scientific realism 
- Anti-Realist
    - You have no reason to believe in electrons, buckyballs, electro magnetic fields.
    - You can only believe what you can observe.
    - better to remain agnostic on the unobservable
- Not an advocate for denial - but agnosticism.
- **Argument** 
    - explaination to truth is retroduction. 
    - Evidence presented with many possible causes, but because a cause fit it is accepted as explaination.
    - how do we know that retroduction works(successful)?
        - chart with evidence for electrons -> not obserbable vs not observed
        - theory is instrument to make preductions. no need to believe in the theory.
    - goal of science is not truth, the goal of science is **Emperical adequacy** 

### Electrocution example
- REalist believes he will be electrocuted by electrons. (believes in the explaination)
- AntiRealist believes he will be electrocuted, but does not care why. (believes in the prediction)
    - Why commit to the explaination, just trust the prediction

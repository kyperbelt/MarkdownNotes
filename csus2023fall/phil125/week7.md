# CSUS PHIL125 week 7

## The crobes case 
> :warning: abandon preconceptions 

**How do we know what we know?** 

Crobes example

**Philosophical attitudes:**
1. **This proves that crobes exist** (naive scientific realist)
2. **Jones used the nottion of Crobes as a useful fiction, an instrument that helped in the predictions.**
3. **Jones did believe in the existance of crobes; Whether or not he is right does not matter.** 

> :construction: Both **Logical Positivist** and **Constructive Empiricists** are antirealists.  
**:warning:IMPORTANT:warning:** **The reliability of instruments can be established by calibrating them using observable entities.** 

<u>**Maxwell**</u>
The use of scientific instruments makes the distinction between observable and unobservable completely arbitrary.

<u>**Bas C. Van Frassen**</u>
- Not a Science Skeptic.
- Trusts Scientific Predictions 
- Claims about unobservables are important. 
- The observable/unobservable distinction is vague but not arbitrary.
    > :warning: vague does not mean arbitrary even though.

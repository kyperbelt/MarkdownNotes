## Questions: 
- Cost comparison: What is the cost of use and payment structure.(for exmaple do you pay per computing hours? flat fee?)
- Ease of Use: How easy is it to setup. How well documented is it (tutorials, references etc.)
- Capabilities: What does this framework allow you to do. What advantages does it offer compared to other.
- Performance: How does it perform compared to other frameworks. Speed is not the most important thing, but it can help with heavy workloads.
- Industry Use: How widely used is this in the industry (remember we are trying to learn marketable skills.)
- Interopability: How easy is it to use other frameworks with this one.

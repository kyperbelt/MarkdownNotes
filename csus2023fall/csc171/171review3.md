* **What is “I” language? Provide an example that does not use “I” language and one that does use “I” language.**
I language is when you express the problem in terms of "I" instead of placing blame on the person you are giving feedback to. This causes them to be less defensive because your feedback feels less like an attack. 

For example, "I noticed you did not turn in your homework, and I am concerned that the exam might be harder than it should be" sounds better than, "You didnt do your homework so you will fail the exam".

* **What does it mean when we say, “Agile teams should manage their own membership”? Why does allowing agile teams to manage their own membership benefit the team?**
When we say "Agile teams should manage their own membership", we mean that the team should be directly involved in the hiring process for their team. This benefits the team because when teams help with the selection of a new member, they are more likely to collaborate and help them because they are invested in their success.


* **Why is safety important for agile teams and how can you create a safe environment for your team?**
Safety is important for agile teams because it makes team members feel secure when giving feedback, seeking for help, experiment, and admit when they have made mistakes. As a manager you can help build a safe environment by using clear and direct language, encouring learning and experimentation, and admitting when you dont know something. That last part is important because when you admit you do not know something, you make it clear to your team that it is ok to now know everything.

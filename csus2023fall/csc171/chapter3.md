## Chapter 3: Building Teamwork with Interpersonal Practices

### Introduction 
* Interpersonal skills are sesential to building team and culture.
* The people on the team must be trated as human, not resources.
* Organization culture will change when people on the team are treated as humans.
* Agile is a human-centric, collaborative approach to product development
    - Teams need the ability to work as a team using interpersonal skills.

### Interpersonal Skills 
* How a person interacts with others.
* Examples: 
    - Active listening
    - Collaboration
    - Empathy
    - Respect
    - Dependability
    - Positive Attitude

### Agile Team Member Interpersonal Skills
* Agile team members must
    - Collaborate with eachother. 
    - Ask eachother for help. 
    - Be adaptable, willint to work on whatever. 
* Agile team members should prefer
    - Doing something good enough for now.
    - Creating experiments try something and receive feedback
    - Be willing to work outside their preferences. 
> :construction: 3M example - they created tape that way?

### Feedback
* What is feedback? 
    - Information about past behavior, delivered in the present, which may influence future behavior.
* People receive feedback from their managers typically once a year.
    - Performance appraisals (see example)
    - Feedback is usually vague
* Peer based feedback
    - From team members instead of people outside the team.
    - Helps team members collaborate, learn, and adapt to what the team needs.

### Provide Feedback
* Create an opening to deliver feedback.
* Describe the behavior or result in a way that the person can hear.
* State the inpact using "I" language.
    > :warning: "You didnt come to class today" vs "I did not see you in class today"

#### Giving critial feedback
- Create culture where people know 
    - feedback is not to critizise
    - it is to improve
- Point to the evidence first
- Good feedback is not about convering the point
    - its about create a condition where they want to hear feedback.
##### Summary
* Make a request for continued or changed behavior.

#### Providing Feedback Example
* You have a product that requires multiple language support. 
* A new tester joins the team discorves problem in the English version.
* He opens three defect reports, one for each language.
* Judy, the dev, has a conversation with him.
> Better to deal with issues quickly before they create a toxic environment.

### Coaching 
* Team members take responsibility for completing work together.
* They coach eachother to help move the work across the board.
* When team members realize they don't work something, they ask for more training or help.
* As a leader, you might be able to help. You might not.

#### External Coaching
* Software development - collaborative effort

### Building trust
* Build by working together.
* Trust is built when teams
    - focust on work
* Individuals are trustworthy
    - they deliver.

### Team Env of Safety
* Teams need safety to build skills
* Building skills helps create safe environment 
    > :warning: no public humiliation.
* Important to 
    - Asl questions
    - Challenge assumptions
    - Find new ways of working together
    - Find new ideas and process
        - Restaurant Example; 

* Safety allows team to manage ambiguity and 
    - learn early by experimenting
    - help admit mistakes
* Safety is created when 
    - encourage learning
    - clear and direct lang
    - admit we dont know
    - set boundries
    - awknowledge when we fail

**Create env in which members feel safe to take risks and not afraid to get in trouble.** 

### Risk Management
* **Traditional Project** 
    - Project manager or functional manager mange risks
* **Safe teams work together to identify and mitigate risks** 
    - Siloed work creates risk.
    > :warning: If only a single person knows how something works and they leave you lose all that domain knowledge.
* **Recognize risks early when they are small.**
    > :information_source: Much chaper to mitigate smaller risks.
* **When an issue occurs, plan on how it can be recovered from quickly**

### Team Membership
* Team manage own membership
    - Typically, managers hire team members
        - Hiring paperwork
        - Job description
        - Screening candidates
        - Interviews
        - Selections
*  High performing teams
    - Manager facilitates the hiring process.
    - **Team members** help with screening, interviewing and selecting.

* Teams who help with selection 
    - Are more collaborative 
    - Help eachother 
    - grow as a team
    - deliver faster
    - invest time and energy into feedback

### Learn Early
* Safe to fail experiments
* Create small steps
* OK to fail - consider learning

### Anti Collaboration Patterns
* People dont want to take risks in front of management
    > Scared to fail, job security
* Team is uncertain about next steps
* Insufficient autonomy - decisions outside the team.
* Unable to manage team membership
    > No control of who gets hired.
* Unfair treatment

### Interpersonal Skill Traps
* Team members dont provide engough feedback to eachother. 
* Team members inflict help when they see a solution.
* Team members sandwich their feedback.
* Not enough Feedback
    - For years orgs recognized and rewarded people for individual work.
        - incentives to work alone and plug along
        - we worked alone for as long as possible
    > :construction: Praise the entire team not individuals.
    - Agile teams
        - Work toegther to move work accross the board, to help finish.
        - Work as generalizing specialists
        - Reward teamwork instead of individual work.
    - Rubber Duck Debugging
    - If you are stuck for longer than X minutes ask for help.
    - Suggest that the team pair program or mob the problem.
        - Two heads are better than one.
* **Inflicting Help**
    - Everyone on your team is smart
        - Some of those people are supper smart
        - They have tons of exp.
        - They are not afraid to help people, even if people dont ask for it.
        > :warning: Be sure people want help before you offer it.
    - Options
        - provide feedback to the coach about what you see.

* **Feedback Sandwich**
    - person **A** provides reinforcing feedback, followed by changed-focused feedback followedagain by reinforcing feedback.
    > :information_source: Give smaller feedback so its easier to digest.
